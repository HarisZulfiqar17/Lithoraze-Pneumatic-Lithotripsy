# Lithoraze, A Pneumatic Lithotripter
A device used to break up bladder / ureter / kidney stones.

# What is Lithotripsy
Lithotripsy is a procedure that breaks up stones in the kidney, bladder, or ureter. In Lithotripsy procedure the physical destruction of hardened masses like kidney stones, Bladder Stone and Uteter Stone. In the cases where the Extracorporeal Lithotripsy proves to be unsuccessful, Intracorporeal Pneumatic Lithotripsy (endoscopic lithotripsy) is the alternative treatment method.

# Working Principle
Pneumatic Lithotripter coverts Kinetic impact energy to a mechanical strain which is passed through probe to the calculus. Lithotripter Hand Piece converts Kinetic Energy to Mechanical Strain and it is passing through probe. When energy is transmitted from the Lithocast probe to the calculus, the result is disintegration of the calculus. Kinectic energy can be adjusted by changing the pressure.

# Key Features
1. Ballistic principle
2. Stroke power adjustment using the input pressure.
3. Stroke frequency ranging from single shot to 20 strokes per second.
4. Digital Pressure measurement.
5. Stroke count of the surgery.
